From the experience of the end user of a drug, which in the context of this project is a patient, we can derive some critical information that might be useful for improving the condition of a patient, can help other patients with similar condition and also help improve the sentiment of certain drug brands. Some studies were performed on how social media influenced the patientâ€™s usage of drugs. Drug review data from www.drugs.com, which captured the reviews of the patients, was analyzed in this work. Insights into the usefulness of the drugs and the associated health conditions described were unearthed. Machine learning algorithms were used to predict the sentiment of the reviews. The approach to perform sentiment analysis and the valuable techniques for cleaning the reviews were explored. An assessment of multiple machine learning models was performed to determine which algorithm works best for the chosen dataset.
