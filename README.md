**Abstract:**

From the experience of the end user of a drug, which in the context of this project is a patient, we can derive some critical information that might be useful for improving the condition of a patient, can help other patients with similar condition and also help improve the sentiment of certain drug brands. Some studies were performed on how social media influenced the patient’s usage of drugs. Drug review data from www.drugs.com, which captured the reviews of the patients, was analyzed in this work. Insights into the usefulness of the drugs and the associated health conditions described were unearthed. Machine learning algorithms were used to predict the sentiment of the reviews. The approach to perform sentiment analysis and the valuable techniques for cleaning the reviews were explored. An assessment of multiple machine learning models was performed to determine which algorithm works best for the chosen dataset.

**INTRODUCTION:**

There is an enormous amount of data available in the medical industry describing the patient’s conditions, the prescribed medicines and the patient’s opinion on these drugs. Much of this information is very complex in the form of plain text. Natural Language Processing, also referred to as NLP, helps in understanding the relationship between the words and making an inference about the words. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, which uses NLP to study the affective state and subjectivity of the text was explored in this project. Supervised machine learning algorithms namely, Logistic Regression, Navies Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine were used to predict the sentiment of the reviews. The goal of this project is to propose the model that performed the best for this dataset. The data set was split to utilize 70% for training the models and 30% as test data for evaluation of the models. The entire work was carried out in Python™.
